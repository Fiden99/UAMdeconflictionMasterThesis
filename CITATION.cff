abstract: >
  This software provides methods for traffic management in urban air mobility.
  It includes optimization models for routing and scheduling, ensuring efficient
  air traffic management in urban environments. The models allow aircraft to
  dynamically adjust their routes if necessary, enhancing flexibility and 
  responsiveness to changing conditions.
