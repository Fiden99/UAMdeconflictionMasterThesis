Our work focuses on urban air mobility, an air transport system designed to move people and goods within and around large, densely populated cities.

For transporting goods, drones are used, while eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft are employed for passenger transport.
This work focuses on the latter.

In the following sections, we summarize the key concepts and findings from the main studies that form the foundation of our research.
