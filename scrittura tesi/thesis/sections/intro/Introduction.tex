Our work focuses on urban air mobility, an air transport system designed to move people and goods within and around large, densely populated cities using eVTOL aircraft, where eVTOL stands for electric vertical take-off and landing. 
In the following sections, we summarize the key concepts and findings from the main works on which our study is based.
