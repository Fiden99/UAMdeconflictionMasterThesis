\section{Conclusions}  
We have shown how the proposed improvements to the previous model introduce a new degree of freedom, leading to better results. In some cases, our approach was able to find solutions where the previous model failed. Additionally, we developed a heuristic that, in all tested cases, was able to find a feasible solution in significantly less time compared to the full model. In most cases, where the full model could not find a solution within an hour, our heuristic produced a solution within a 10\% optimality gap.  

\section{Future Work}  
There are several potential directions for future research. One possibility is to develop a branch-and-price algorithm, particularly when free paths are available, for example, by using the shortest path problem as the pricing problem.  

Another avenue for exploration is applying our new model or heuristic to the work proposed by \cite{portoleau-2024} to determine whether better results can be achieved.  

Additionally, studying the complexity of our problem could be of interestâ€”specifically, whether it remains NP-hard or belongs to a higher complexity class, such as $P^{NP}$ or $NP^{NP}$.  

Finally, an interesting alternative approach could be to develop an algorithm based on the critical path method to solve the deconflicting problem, assuming a predefined priority order of passage.
