 abstract = {Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize transportation. It will exploit the third dimension to help smooth ground traffic in densely populated areas. This new paradigm in mobility will require methods to ensure safety and maximize efficiency. We propose to use mathematical optimization to address tactical deconfliction in UAM. Our approach is envisioned as a way of modelling and solving tactical conflicts, but also as means for assessing future infrastructures with potential utility in the design phase. We leverage envisioned UAM corridors to provide a mathematical definition of vehicle separation. A mathematical formulation is then proposed, which minimizes the total deviation from flight schedules needed to avoid loss of pairwise separation. The deconfliction is based on both airborne adjustments (through speed changes) and ground delays (holds relative to the scheduled take-off). Our experimental setup includes three use cases standing for different sources of conflicts and three synthetic UAM network topologies, which represent heterogeneous realistic scenarios. Vehicle and network capabilities are represented through model parameters, which allows us to analyse their impact on the quality of the deconfliction. Finally, insightful comparisons between our approach and both a local deconfliction and a fairness-oriented version are provided.},

  abstract  = {Thanks to recent technical progress, it is now possible to consider air mobility for people at the scale of a city. In this work, we focus on a robust strategic planning problem in an urban air mobility context. For this purpose, we model this problem as a two-stage robust optimization problem in which we aim at computing a schedule that is the least costly, from the user’s point of view, to repair in its worst case scenario. The problem is solved with the adversarial Benders method. The subproblem obtained by this method is then solved by three different heuristics. The first one is based on a local search that relies on a scenario dominance rule that allows to significantly reduce the search space. The different parameters involved in this local search have been selected following an experimental analysis. The two others heuristics are based on a more constrained variant of the subproblem. These heuristics are then compared experimentally.},

This chapter reviews several recent developments in the convex analysis approach to integer programming. These developments are based on viewing integer programs as disjunctive programs—that is, linear programs with disjunctive constraints. Apart from the fact that this is the most natural and straightforward way of stating many problems involving logical conditions (dichotomies and implications), the disjunctive programming approach seems to be significant for zero-one programming, both theoretically and practically. On the theoretical side, it provides neat structural characterizations, which offer new insights. On the practical side, it produces a variety of cutting planes with desirable properties and offers several ways of combining cutting planes with branch and bound. The chapter also presents linear (or nonlinear) programs with disjunctive constraints. The main conceptual tool used in studying the structural properties of disjunctive programs is polarity. A linear programming characterization of the convex hull of feasible points of a disjunctive program is also discussed.}

In a large engineering project, for example, almost all the engineering and craft skills are involved as well as the functions represented by research, development, design, procurement, construction, vendors, fabricators and the customer. Management must devise plans which will tell with as much accuracy as possible how the efforts of the people representing these functions should be directed toward the project's completion. In order to devise such plans and implement them, management must be able to collect pertinent information to accomplish the following tasks:(1) To form a basis for prediction and planning(2) To evaluate alternative plans for accomplishing the objective(3) To check progress against current plans and objectives, and(4) To form a basis for obtaining the facts so that decisions can be made and the job can be done.},
